ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Isgav Saranga, nice to meet you!

I'm a software developer with experience in developing desktop applications in C# and VB.Net. Furthermore, I have experience writing SQL queries and procedures as well as a solid command of Python. Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree (B.Sc.) in Computer Science at the Open University of Israel, and I expect to graduate in early 2022. I'm interested in data science, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP).
